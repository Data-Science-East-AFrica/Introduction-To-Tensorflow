    "\n",
    "Tensorflow works on data flow graphs where nodes are the mathematical operations and the edges are the data in the for tensors, hence the name Tensor-Flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tesorflow supports three main type of data types namely [Constants](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant), [Variables](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable) and [Placeholders](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder).  I think it is fairly evident from the name what they are and what are they used for. We will keep discussing them as we use them later but for now it’s enough to know that they are the three data types used in tensorflow.\n"
